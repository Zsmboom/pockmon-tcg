                        <p>In "Card Challenge," you can randomly obtain 1 card from expansion packs opened by other players. Check if any players have pulled cards you want. Don't miss special Card Challenges that appear during events.</p>

                        <h3>Hourglass System</h3>
                        <p>Pokémon TCG Pocket uses hourglasses for pack opening. You get two free draws daily (one every 12 hours), and each hourglass reduces wait time by 1 hour. Thus, 12 hourglasses equal one draw, and 10 draws require 120 hourglasses.</p>

                        <h3>Card Challenge Strategy</h3>
                        <p>Choose packs from other players daily for random card draws. Select packs based on your deck needs to improve deck-building efficiency.</p>

                        <p>Complete single-player mode battles early to familiarize yourself with game mechanics and earn hourglass rewards to speed up card collection.</p>

                        <h3>Daily Missions</h3>
